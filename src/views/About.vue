  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Zeb.</p>
  <p>I'm a photographer based in Los Angeles, California.</p>
  <p>I started out with photography from a young age, getting my first camera (a Nikon point and shoot) when I was about
    eight years old.
    Since then I have always been drawn to photography, and love to capture the essence of the areas, objects and people
    around me.</p>
